                <h3>New Document 1:</h3>
                <p>I love the design of this website and the fact that it is ever expanding, not only in the individual Google Doc-esque formatting, but also in the form of new tabs. It’s very similar to how many people might write an essay or do a group project. There is a lot of movement and orderly chaos, but it is balanced out by the soft color palette. It makes me think more about the type of interactions I could possibly include in my own personal website later down the line. </p>

                <h3>The Web's Grain:</h3>
                <p>This was a really cool way to reformat/reimagine a talk that would typically be given in person. There was a lot of engagement with the user and the use of videos to explain concepts surrounding responsive design was really neat! I also enjoyed the conversation on edgelessness on the web. I typically wireframe in boxes or long rectangles, but it’s cool to imagine the web as a vast infinite void that you can fill and rearrange as you please. Frank does a great job of providing rich content on the page while also giving the reader room to breathe. I actually didn’t even realize how fast I finished the article. </p>
