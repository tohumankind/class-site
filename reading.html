                <h3>New Document 1:</h3>
                <p>I love the design of this website and the fact that it is ever expanding, not only in the individual Google Doc-esque formatting, but also in the form of new tabs. It’s very similar to how many people might write an essay or do a group project. There is a lot of movement and orderly chaos, but it is balanced out by the soft color palette. It makes me think more about the type of interactions I could possibly include in my own personal website later down the line. </p>

                <h3>The Web's Grain:</h3>
                <p>This was a really cool way to reformat/reimagine a talk that would typically be given in person. There was a lot of engagement with the user and the use of videos to explain concepts surrounding responsive design was really neat! I also enjoyed the conversation on edgelessness on the web. I typically wireframe in boxes or long rectangles, but it’s cool to imagine the web as a vast infinite void that you can fill and rearrange as you please. Frank does a great job of providing rich content on the page while also giving the reader room to breathe. I actually didn’t even realize how fast I finished the article. </p>

                <h3>Ford Reboot the World:</h3>
                <p>I really enjoyed this article because it raises a lot of questions on ownership. I remember when the Ashley Madison thing blew up on the news, and I didn't understand the gravity of the situation at the time besides the fact that it exposed cheaters. Although now I understand that the idea of a database like that being open and public is insaneee. All those pieces of data are connected to individuals lives and with the added context of Ashley Madison as a web space, it doesn't put the users in a good light. Now that things are able to be so private, I wonder if that is a good thing for the people of today. You can get away with a lot more than if our services and databases were all connected which is nice for autonomy's sake. I wonder what the Internet would be like if anyone at any time could see what another user was doing. Would it keep us more accountable and in reality? Or would we end up using the web even more than we do now?</p>

                <h3>Spirit Surfing:</h3>
                <p>I feel like this piece gave a new prospective on what it means to search and access websites on the Internet. It's nice that the web can be a tool for knowledge seeking, but it's even more powerful that the Internet can be a place to reframe or reimagine the info presented to us on the web. (similar to the fork analogy) I also find it funny how he describes images. Pieces of art that are infinately sized, but similar to cigar thimbles. Its cool to think of webpages that use images as digital floating entities for example sites like Instagram.</p>
