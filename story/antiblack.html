      <h1>what does <span style="color: #39ff14">anti-black</span> mean?</h1>
      <h5>The <span style="color: #39ff14">personal, cultural, social, legal, and structural attacks </span>on black people. A term that some feel should replace racism as it is more focused on black people alone rather than all people of color.</h5>

      <h1>who can be <span style="color: #39ff14">anti-black</span>?</h1>
      <h5>Anyone and everyone. Even black people. <span style="color: #39ff14">Internalized anti-blackness</span> is a real thing that happens within black people. It has a lot to do with the context they grew up in and the media's portrayal of black people over the years.</h5>

      <h1>"I'm not racist. I support things like BlackLivesMatter and Anti-Police Brutality Efforts!"</h1>
      <h5>Also take note of possible <a href="https://www.abovethebottomline.com/archive/065" class="implink" target="_blank">anti-black companies</a> you give money to and <span style="color: #39ff14">media</span> you consume. Because all of these systems are <span style="color: #39ff14">rooted in white supremacy.</span> Fortunately, there are resources, but you have to do the work to stay informed as an active member of our society.</h5>
