        <h1><span style="color: #39ff14">Flint doesn't have clean water.</span> Karen Weaver, the recently elected mayor said "Had the city not been either <span style="color: #39ff14">predominately African American and poor</span>, the crisis may not have happened, or else <span style="color: #39ff14">the response would have been different."</span></h1>

        <h5>Local and state governments have a habit of ignoring the demands and needs of the citizens they serve, especially when it involves those from marginalized groups. This is a prime example of what happens when<span style="color: #39ff14">government puts the needs of business over people.</span> Please take time to really look at your representative's track records to see if they are making a stand for marginalized folks. So when election time comes you can have someone on your side in times of crisis like <span style="color: #39ff14">Karen Weaver.</span></h5>
